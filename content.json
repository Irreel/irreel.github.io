Abstract: Starting from a broad question How online teaching affects studentsâ€™ learning experience, we conduct a user research to find Problems students meet during online learning and why. Through contextual inquiry, we identified three major problems. To narrow down our focus, we selected Low-efficiency as our interesting problem space to dig further and understand its chains of causality. To solve the problem, we propose a virtual study room APP after our brainstorming and idea critics. Then we design different fidelity protoype and storyboards. At last, evaluate our design via several usability testing including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough. Report and prototype are not public.","link":"/2020/06/18/colearner/"},{"title":"Qing&#39;shan Natural Reserve Trail Experience Design","text":"2021.01-2021.02 Teamwork Our goal is to design a new trail in Qingâ€™shan Village with better user experience and little influence on nature.

The game is simulated based on Python Piskvork Gomoku Manager for Gomocup AI Tournament. Implementation: Use three different algorithms as follows. Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning Monte Carlo Tree Search Reinforcement Learning (Specifically, two shallow neural network for evaluation and action prediction respectively and was trained with self-teaching.)

The proposed linear equation has good features to enable Conjugate Gradient Iterative method and its variants to speed up the computation. The project implements the new computation algorithm and experimental results on different datasets solidates its efficiency.","link":"/2022/01/18/simrank-hin/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Project","slug":"Project","link":"/tags/Project/"},{"name":"NLP","slug":"NLP","link":"/tags/NLP/"},{"name":"Design","slug":"Design","link":"/tags/Design/"},{"name":"HCI","slug":"HCI","link":"/tags/HCI/"},{"name":"RL","slug":"RL","link":"/tags/RL/"},{"name":"Coursework","slug":"Coursework","link":"/tags/Coursework/"},{"name":"Graph","slug":"Graph","link":"/tags/Graph/"},{"name":"User Study","slug":"User-Study","link":"/tags/User-Study/"}],"categories":[]}
