Abstract: Starting from a broad question How online teaching affects studentsâ€™ learning experience, we conduct a user research to find Problems students meet during online learning and why. Through contextual inquiry, we identified three major problems. To narrow down our focus, we selected Low-efficiency as our interesting problem space to dig further and understand its chains of causality. To solve the problem, we propose a virtual study room APP after our brainstorming and idea critics. Then we design different fidelity protoype and storyboards. At last, evaluate our design via several usability testing including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough. Report and prototype are not public.","link":"/2020/03/01/CoLearner-Virtual-Study-Room/"},{"title":"Conversatonal Recommender Systems via Knowledge Graph based Semantic Fusion","text":"2021.03-2021.06 Final Project for Social Network Mining Background: In order to solving problems like cold start and accessibility in traditional recommender systems, the project aims to implement a Chatbot which could recommend items to users via conversational interaction. Implementation: We regenerated code in reference*. I was responsible for language generation module (Transformer) in the project and improved its generated language quality compared with the original one.

The proposed linear equation has good features to enable Conjugate Gradient Iterative method and its variants to speed up the computation. The project implements the new computation algorithm and experimental results on different datasets solidates its efficiency.","link":"/2021/12/01/Fast-Computation-of-SimRank-Enhanced-by-Semantics-on-HIN/"},{"title":"Gomoku AI Agent","text":"2021.09-2021.12 Final Project for Artificial Intelligence Background: The goal is to implement an artificial intelligence agent playing Gomoku (Five in a Row) as good as possible. The game is simulated based on Python Piskvork Gomoku Manager for Gomocup AI Tournament. Implementation: Use three different algorithms as follows. Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning Monte Carlo Tree Search Reinforcement Learning (Specifically, two shallow neural network for evaluation and action prediction respectively and was trained with self-teaching.)
