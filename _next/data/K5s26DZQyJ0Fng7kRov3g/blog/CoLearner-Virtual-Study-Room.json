Through contextual inquiry, we identified three major problems. To narrow down our focus, we selected Low-efficiency as our interesting problem space to dig further and understand its chains of causality. To solve the problem, we propose a virtual study room APP after our brainstorming and idea critics. Then we design different fidelity protoype and storyboards. At last, evaluate our design via several usability testing including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough.\n- Report and prototype are not public."}},"__N_SSG":true}
